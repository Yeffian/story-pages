“It’s been a long day”, I mutter to myself as I plop myself down for the day, feeling the fatigue in my bones dissolve into the soft folds of the couch. As I grabbed my beer and my old TV fluttered to life, I sat there, reflecting on the day. My job is one with very few breaks, and times such as these, where I can just be left alone with my own thoughts, are very rare and very welcomed. I take another swig of the cold beer, switching through channels to find the sports channel. My favourite team was on today, and I was not missing the game. 

As I tune into the channel, my TV suddenly starts shaking violently. The can flies off my table, and the entire house starts to shake violently. “Earthquake”, I think to myself, before bolting out of the door into the street. I stare at my apartment complex building, which is now, somehow, completely static. Huh?! I just ran out of my house because the entire building was shaking, now there’s no movement? Weird, but maybe it’s just a figment of my imagination? Maybe I’ve had one too many beers. I headed back inside, confused but trying to shrug it off. 

I sit back down, start watching the game. Right as I’m getting into it, it happens again. The walls start shaking like an earthquake. This time I look out of my window, and sure enough, nothing is happening outside. Now I’m seriously confused, but at the same time, I can’t be bothered to do detective work right now. I sit back down again, hoping whatever is causing it decides to leave me alone today. 10-15 minutes go by, nothing. I let out a sigh of relief , thinking that I can finally get some peace.

Nope! A few minutes later, the walls start shaking harder than ever. At this point, my blood is boiling. I came home after a long day, and all I wanted was a drink and a relaxing night. But it seems that I can’t even have that. What's different this time though, is that I could hear sound. It sounded like…drums? Yeah, drums! Someone was playing drums, that's what all the noise was about! Slowly, I started putting the pieces together. The kid who lived above me was into this overly loud, pointless screaming he called “music”. I’d usually let it go, but you know what? Not today. I’d had it with this incessant noise, which I had to endure. Every. Single. Day. I work all day every day, and if I can’t come home to some peace and quiet, I wasn’t going to have that. I’d already talked about this with our landlords, but according to them it is “self expression” and that they cannot do anything about it. Self-expression? What part of hitting things is self expression? What are you expressing, the fact that you don’t have anything better to do with your time? 

I was not having any more of it. I stormed out and up to his floor, and banged on his door loudly. The door was opened by a young kid, probably 17-18 years of age? His hands were wrapped in bandages and bleeding, fingers bruised, cuts all over his forearms and his entire body glazed in sweat. His eyes looked puffy and bloodshot and his hair all over the place. He was holding his drumsticks in his left hand, which looked worn out and on the verge of breaking. 

“Do you have any idea how late it is?! People are trying to rest or relax, and you're over here making all this racket? Unlike you, people actually have work or school to do in the morning, and we need our rest. Do you even think about the other people in this building? What use is all this anyways? You aren’t going to get anywhere just playing drums. Do you even..”.

I have no idea how long I kept going for. Looking back on it, I regret every word I said. I overreacted far too much for something without knowing the full story. I never even let him explain his side. After I finished, he just stared me in the eyes. His drumsticks fell from his hands with a soft tap. He simply said, “I’m sorry sir, it won’t happen again.”, and closed the door.

Feeling annoyed but satisfied, I went back down to my place, only to realise the game was over and I couldn’t even see the score.  “Kids”, I muttered under my breath before downing what was left of the can. I kicked my shoes off and went to bed, thinking no further of the interaction.


I woke up the next day, and was getting ready as usual. All of a sudden, I heard a sharp knock on my door, followed by a strong voice, calling “Police, open up!”. Police? At my house? Shocked and confused, I rushed to the door and opened it, revealing two sombre-looking police officers, one holding a small pocket notebook and the other speaking quietly into his radio. “Good morning, sir”, the one holding the notebook said, “we know this may be a bit unexpected, but could you please step outside and come with us?”. “M- me? Am I being arrested? Where am I going? What is going on?”, I started blabbering, flabbergasted and confused. “No sir, please calm down. No one is arresting you, and you aren’t in any trouble. We just want to ask a few questions.”.

I stepped out, and they started asking me a lot of questions about myself, but also about the kid from last night. “Wait, sorry, but why exactly are you asking me questions about him? I mean, the kid lives right upstairs, and I’m sure he wouldn’t mind you guys waking him up.”. The officers shared a look, like they knew something I didn’t. “Sir, ‘the kid’, is dead. He committed suicide. And your name, was on the suicide note. There was nothing else, no reasoning, just your name, and the names of some people we have yet to identify. That's why we came to you first.”

I simply stood there, in front of these police officers, all the events of last night running through my head at 10x speed. The bleeding hands, the broken sticks. To do that much damage, you need to have been playing with anger. With rage. Bloodshot eyes, he was crying. The drums, they were his escape. Just like watching the game was my escape. 

I had just realised what I had done. I sank to my knees, as the whole story became clearer and clearer, like a foggy window being cleaned. The defeated voice, the cuts on his arms, it all made sense now. The kid had died, and it was my fault. I killed him. I felt the world slow down around me, the officer's voices slowly being tuned out like a broken radio. My vision blurred, my skin felt cold and clammy. Then, it all went dark.

If you Google the meaning of voice, it will say:

# voice
## (noun)

-  The sound produced in a person’s larynx and uttered through the mouth, such as speech or song. 


But in contrast, the second definition is as follows:

-  A particular opinion, or attitude expressed 

Now, depending on who you are, you may relate to one more than the other. If you are of a more direct disposition, you may immediately associate it with the first definition; the literal meaning of voice; the produced sound. But others, on some deeper thinking, might find the second, less common meaning to make more sense to you. 

Whichever meaning of voice you relate with the most, one thing is undeniable; it is incredibly important in all aspects of life. But why is it so? 

Our voice is what we communicate with. Some of us may not realize it, but we use our voice every day, both in terms of opinions and in terms of literal sound. Any time you ask for something or talk with your friend, annoying sibling or parents, you are using your voice. See, I just did it again, and I’m not even talking, I'm writing! 

These fervent frequencies are the one of the main things which build up the initial impression we have on people. One of the first things people use to create their mental image of us, right after appearance, is our voice. People can create a decent assumption about things such as your age and gender, and even guide their assumptions (don’t have to be accurate!)  on character traits such as confidence and how trustworthy you are. In other words, our voices are what set us apart.

But again, as we just talked about, physical properties are not the only thing that constitute a voice. Voice also means your opinions, any attitude or ideas you have. These opinions can have a very strong effect on the world, even when you do not realize. Any time you express your opinion, someone's brain is kicking into action, something is changing as a result; every expressed opinion makes some impact on somebody or something. For example, any time you give any presentation, or in my case as a student, whenever I work on school projects, the things you say have a huge impact on your teachers, peers, and really anyone hearing/understanding what you have to say. You might not think it is huge, but you hold the power to *make* them think, which is a very useful skill.

So what about the people who *physically* cannot speak? They still have a voice, but how do they express it? Well, now we might need to challenge our initial definition. If we say that someone “using their voice” means them expressing their opinion, where in that definition is it written that noise needs to be created? The actions of a person can tell us just as much about their opinions as them talking about it. In fact, most of the time it actually tells us *more* than we would know if they just spoke about it.

So maybe, the definition that we started this whole essay with, can be switched with the second definition. While scientifically and factually, the first one is still correct by a long shot, but in terms of its actual use in the world on a large scale, the second, and less popular definition seems to be the most correct one.

The importance of your voice is something that is being discussed much more in the modern world, but still, hundreds of people around the world do not understand just how important and powerful this one thing that all of us have, can really be. No matter if you are of the scientific stock and still think voice is nothing more than the sounds produced by your vocal tract, or believe it to be your opinions and ideas you express, our voice is one of the most important things we have, and we should cherish and utilize it to its fullest potential.

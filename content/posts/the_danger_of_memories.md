“Grandpa! Grandpa! Can you tell us another story, pretty please?”

I chuckled, “It’s late kiddos, you need to get yourself to bed.”

“Please? We can’t sleep without your stories!”
“Not now guys, it's late.”

“Pleasee?”, they clamoured, giving puppy eyes so overwhelmingly cute that it could melt stone and unwrap poison ivy curled around the coldest of hearts. “Not today”, I said, using every bit of self control I had not to let the cool grasp of logic slip on the hot coals of their cuteness. “Besides, all my stories are all old memories; I'll be going on for hours. It’ll be more dangerous for me than it will be for you.” I added with another satisfied chuckle. 

 “But Mummy always tells us that memories are beautiful and we should cherish them! You can cherish your memories by telling them to us!”. Damm, these kids are good, I thought. But no. I say it is for them to rest, but it really is more for my own safety than theirs. I reached for the light and whispered, “Memories are a fickle thing. Beautiful, yes, but dangerous as well. You’ll learn when you get to my age.” 

“We won’t sleep if you don’t tell us something!”
“Yeah, no story, no sleep!”

My immediate reaction was laughter at the absurdity of the fact that these 2 10-year olds were going on strike to get me to tell them bedtime stories; before realising that they were on the winning side. No story, no sleep; and I needed them to sleep if I had any hope of completing my book. 

“You should get into debate”, I told them as I reached over to flip the night lamp on, the soft thump of the switch bathing the room in a pleasant amber glow. Their excited puppy eyes glew even brighter, as if enamoured by their success at getting me to fold, while their boyish smile introduced a warmth like that felt around a fireplace at Christmas. The sweet scented air freshener filled the room with a sweet aroma; it reminded me of marshmallows and roasting cinnamon. The air conditioner whirred gently above, the low hum mimicking that of a fire crackling in its kindling. The kids gave each other a knowing smile - the sly grin of “we got him”.

I sat down on the soft mattress, as the child sized bedframe groaned at the weight of an adult. The children squealed in happiness before scrambling back to give me space; like disciples drawing back to let the master regale them with his wisdom. 

“Alright, let’s keep this short.” At least I hoped to. I reluctantly but passionately began to recount some stories that floated to my brain. As I kept going, going deeper into my childhood, deeper into my experiences throughout my life, I started losing track of time. Rambunctious laughter echoed across the room, as the clock ticked away, forgotten by the concept of bedtimes and logic and ignored by the infectious joy of nostalgia. 
I told them stories of my old school camps, of how we explored the vast forests behind our small houses with nothing but bowie knives, flashlights and teenage hormones. I told them of the treacherous snakes and other reptiles that lay in the shadows, of the stupid escapades we went on; stupid, but the most fun i’ve had in my life. 

We were running through the hallways – straight out of a horror movie – as the security chased close behind us, flashlights bouncing off the smooth cement walls of the building, the only thing illuminating the numerous posters up for student government, all making obviously far fetched claims about student safety and other political buzzwords. “Student safety, huh?”, I thought while running through the corridors at 2am with my friends, while being chased by the literal police. I turned corner after corner, slammed through door after door, the expected fatigue from our lack of sleep long forgotten. In fact, the only thing that ran through me was energy, pure stamina that can only be experienced in the body of a young, dumb teenager. 

I hadn’t felt this kind of energy in years; the recklessness, the speed, the strength - I couldn’t begin to explain how much I missed it. But as I rammed through the rickety doors that led into the school, something felt off. Last time this happened - well, the only time this happened - there was nothing on my mind except the adrenal gland going wild. Now, there’s other things happening. I was thinking about more. I was…considering risks? 

“I might not make that jump”
“Should I wait for the light to cross?”

Wait. No teenagers consider issues like that. Especially in that much adrenaline? Something isn’t right here.

I tried to slow down, but it was as if my body would not respond. My feet kept pushing harder and harder, not listening to my brains demands to stop. I urged my eyes to shut, expecting a violent collision; not only did my eyes not close but nothing happened. Of course nothing happened. I’ve been through this all! 

I ran over the road and kept sprinting away, taking off through the parks. My brain swam with confusion, but my body spurred on with all the misguided confidence of a youthful teenager. I knew every detail of the night; every turn I made, every awful, idiotic and downright dangerous choice I made being re-enacted in front of me against my will. 

As the memory stretched out, from the escape from the school to all the things we did after which, for the benefit of the innocent eyes reading this, I will leave out, I realized I was stuck here. I tried everything, from trying to focus on where I was supposed to be to thinking of sad memories to cry myself out, or psych myself out back into the real life. Nothing worked. I was living my life out from that day, with no way back, but knowing exactly where I was supposed to be.

Remember when I said memories were dangerous? Yeah. This is what I meant.

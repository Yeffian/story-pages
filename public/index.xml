      <description>“STOP IT!”, I cried, as glass hurled across the room, smashing into the wall with a sharp crack. He turned from his target, paying no attention to me, to find his next weapon, rustling around the dark room with a depraved thirst for anything; anything which could harm, anything which would draw blood. As this monster of a man, nothing but a mere shadow of the man who I thought I knew, stormed around for his next to-be-projectile, I turned around to look at the woman lying on the floor, her gentle hands cradling the sea of red pouring from her marked and bruised forehead.</description>

      <description>“It’s been a long day”, I mutter to myself as I plop myself down for the day, feeling the fatigue in my bones dissolve into the soft folds of the couch. As I grabbed my beer and my old TV fluttered to life, I sat there, reflecting on the day. My job is one with very few breaks, and times such as these, where I can just be left alone with my own thoughts, are very rare and very welcomed.</description>

      <description>If you Google the meaning of voice, it will say:
voice (noun) The sound produced in a person’s larynx and uttered through the mouth, such as speech or song. But in contrast, the second definition is as follows:
A particular opinion, or attitude expressed Now, depending on who you are, you may relate to one more than the other. If you are of a more direct disposition, you may immediately associate it with the first definition; the literal meaning of voice; the produced sound.</description>

[{"content":"“STOP IT!”, I cried, as glass hurled across the room, smashing into the wall with a sharp crack. He turned from his target, paying no attention to me, to find his next weapon, rustling around the dark room with a depraved thirst for anything; anything which could harm, anything which would draw blood. As this monster of a man, nothing but a mere shadow of the man who I thought I knew, stormed around for his next to-be-projectile, I turned around to look at the woman lying on the floor, her gentle hands cradling the sea of red pouring from her marked and bruised forehead.\nCounting my stars that the malevolent creature had his back turned, I held my breath and sprinted to her side, doing all I could to get her shaking body out of the room. The smell of freshly drawn blood filled my nostrils, mixing with the metallic scent of whatever objects the bastard had thrown at her. As I grabbed below her shoulders in an attempt to pull her away, I heard a dull crack followed by a definite thud. I felt around the unnaturally tender area; broken shoulders, both left and right as far as I could feel. Her face was mangled, her gorgeous curly hair ripped in places and scattered roughly around her scarred face. She wanted to scream, but understood what I was doing; she might have been beaten to a pulp, but my mom was no slouch when it came to situational awareness.\nI pulled her warm body away as quietly as I could, as the devil kept trawling through and ripping the room apart in his blind rage. Every second, every rustle of her failing body on the wooden floor, felt like it was being stretched to hours. The door was right behind, but moving to it felt like it took an eternity. The clock on the wall ticked mercilessly, an endless reminder of the fact that he could turn around at any moment, and it would all be over. I looked behind me, gauging if I could provide her the luxury of dragging her slower and lessening her pain, or to pull her with the last bit of energy I had in my already sore arms. Almost there, I thought, as the door lay open mere centimeters away, slightly ajar but enough to fit through without making too much noise.\nI reached the door. As I tiptoed out, bending her arms around to get her through, something changed. I was too far to see him at this point, but there was no longer the chaotic rummaging that was coming from the far end of the room. It was silent. Pure silence. My brain told me to take her and run, but every nerve and muscle in my body tightened, frozen to the spot. Something was wrong. He was out for blood, so why would he stop looking for the knife now? Right as my brain was kicking back into action and preparing to move out of the door and the fuck out of there, a contorted scream erupted, as if coming from the pits of hell itself. “BOY”, it shouted, and the large ebony cross flying towards me was the last thing I saw before it all plunged into the dark.\nAs I walk around, my cane scanning thoroughly in front of me, I wonder; could my life have gone anywhere else? What would have happened if I hadn’t made the move, and stayed in the corner?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/abuse/","summary":"“STOP IT!”, I cried, as glass hurled across the room, smashing into the wall with a sharp crack.

First of all, I must preface my speech by highlighting that there is not just one issue that is the most important for the world; there are several problems which impact many different demographics, and the answer to this question will probably vary greatly from person to person. This is simply my answer to the question, based on experiences I have had and things I have seen and heard from others within my community.\nHumour me for a second, and imagine this: A young teen is on social media and VoIP apps, and knows many people around the world. But due to these online friends, times meant for family bonding like dinner times or game nights are neglected. While the teen sows and nurtures the seeds which can grow into a broader friend group and wider relationships, the roots closer to home, which can keep them going through their hardest moments, start to unravel and shrivel away. While this might sound like I am preaching to the choir here, this is something that happens surprisingly often within households.\nNow, I do not pretend to be perfect in this regard as well, because I have probably done exactly what was mentioned above before, more than once. Neither am I saying that social media is the devil and it is the biggest problem plaguing our communities. Suggesting that would be lunacy, as the advent of social media and the usage of computers to further communication has proven to be an incredible asset to the entire world time and time again. However, focusing on the numerous positives of the internet can sometimes lead us to forget about these negatives. So, my proposal is that the biggest issue facing the world is not the digitalisation of the world, but the over digitalisation, and how not only teenagers, but the wider world, seem to use technology in places it does not belong, without anticipating the downsides it could bring.\nNow, if you look at the problem from a broader perspective, we realise that the main demographic to focus on here is the young teens. Again, and I stress this as one of my main points, that the problem does not lie just with that group, and there are many adults who are in the same predicament as well. However, by and large, teenagers are the largest group where this phenomenon of making wider connections while forgetting those closest to you is observed. Statistics show that over 95% of teenagers use social media on a daily basis, and of that 95%, 57% of them have claimed to make online friends. Here, in terms of the Commonwealth Values, Value No. 13, “Importance of Young People in The Commonwealth”, speaks to me louder than the other values here.\nAs the value suggests, young people play an incredibly important role in the Commonwealth\u0026rsquo;s continued growth, and especially in this issue, I feel that proper guidance by parents and the wider community is the best solution, along with understanding their children\u0026rsquo;s motivations for their actions. Of course, this is already in effect, and in no small scale either. However, the technique of providing this guidance differs greatly from household to household, and that, in my opinion, could be one of the things slowing us down. While I do not consider myself as any authority to give parenting advice, or in any way talk about how to discipline anyone, but from my experience, a little bit of kindness goes a long way. Explaining to them that both relationships are important, but family will be the force that will always be there, and reinforcing it through positive reinforcement as opposed to only telling them, from my experience, is always the most successful method.\nI end this speech with a quote from the late Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, which I think relates to this topic. “No age group has a monopoly of wisdom, and indeed I think the young can sometimes be wiser than us. But, the older I get, the more conscious I become of the difficulties young people have to face as they learn to live in the modern world.”\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/digital_familial_divide/","summary":"Esteemed members of the Commonwealth, thank you for all gathering here today to discuss the issues that face the world, and allowing me to speak my piece on what I think that problem is.

As I grabbed my beer and my old TV fluttered to life, I sat there, reflecting on the day. My job is one with very few breaks, and times such as these, where I can just be left alone with my own thoughts, are very rare and very welcomed. I take another swig of the cold beer, switching through channels to find the sports channel. My favourite team was on today, and I was not missing the game.\nAs I tune into the channel, my TV suddenly starts shaking violently. The can flies off my table, and the entire house starts to shake violently. “Earthquake”, I think to myself, before bolting out of the door into the street. I stare at my apartment complex building, which is now, somehow, completely static. Huh?! I just ran out of my house because the entire building was shaking, now there’s no movement? Weird, but maybe it’s just a figment of my imagination? Maybe I’ve had one too many beers. I headed back inside, confused but trying to shrug it off.\nI sit back down, start watching the game. Right as I’m getting into it, it happens again. The walls start shaking like an earthquake. This time I look out of my window, and sure enough, nothing is happening outside. Now I’m seriously confused, but at the same time, I can’t be bothered to do detective work right now. I sit back down again, hoping whatever is causing it decides to leave me alone today. 10-15 minutes go by, nothing. I let out a sigh of relief , thinking that I can finally get some peace.\nNope! A few minutes later, the walls start shaking harder than ever. At this point, my blood is boiling. I came home after a long day, and all I wanted was a drink and a relaxing night. But it seems that I can’t even have that. What\u0026rsquo;s different this time though, is that I could hear sound. It sounded like…drums? Yeah, drums! Someone was playing drums, that\u0026rsquo;s what all the noise was about! Slowly, I started putting the pieces together. The kid who lived above me was into this overly loud, pointless screaming he called “music”. I’d usually let it go, but you know what? Not today. I’d had it with this incessant noise, which I had to endure. Every. Single. Day. I work all day every day, and if I can’t come home to some peace and quiet, I wasn’t going to have that. I’d already talked about this with our landlords, but according to them it is “self expression” and that they cannot do anything about it. Self-expression? What part of hitting things is self expression? What are you expressing, the fact that you don’t have anything better to do with your time?\nI was not having any more of it. I stormed out and up to his floor, and banged on his door loudly. The door was opened by a young kid, probably 17-18 years of age? His hands were wrapped in bandages and bleeding, fingers bruised, cuts all over his forearms and his entire body glazed in sweat. His eyes looked puffy and bloodshot and his hair all over the place. He was holding his drumsticks in his left hand, which looked worn out and on the verge of breaking.\n“Do you have any idea how late it is?! People are trying to rest or relax, and you\u0026rsquo;re over here making all this racket? Unlike you, people actually have work or school to do in the morning, and we need our rest. Do you even think about the other people in this building? What use is all this anyways? You aren’t going to get anywhere just playing drums. Do you even..”.\nI have no idea how long I kept going for. Looking back on it, I regret every word I said. I overreacted far too much for something without knowing the full story. I never even let him explain his side. After I finished, he just stared me in the eyes. His drumsticks fell from his hands with a soft tap. He simply said, “I’m sorry sir, it won’t happen again.”, and closed the door.\nFeeling annoyed but satisfied, I went back down to my place, only to realise the game was over and I couldn’t even see the score. “Kids”, I muttered under my breath before downing what was left of the can. I kicked my shoes off and went to bed, thinking no further of the interaction.\nI woke up the next day, and was getting ready as usual. All of a sudden, I heard a sharp knock on my door, followed by a strong voice, calling “Police, open up!”. Police? At my house? Shocked and confused, I rushed to the door and opened it, revealing two sombre-looking police officers, one holding a small pocket notebook and the other speaking quietly into his radio. “Good morning, sir”, the one holding the notebook said, “we know this may be a bit unexpected, but could you please step outside and come with us?”. “M- me? Am I being arrested? Where am I going? What is going on?”, I started blabbering, flabbergasted and confused. “No sir, please calm down. No one is arresting you, and you aren’t in any trouble. We just want to ask a few questions.”.\nI stepped out, and they started asking me a lot of questions about myself, but also about the kid from last night. “Wait, sorry, but why exactly are you asking me questions about him? I mean, the kid lives right upstairs, and I’m sure he wouldn’t mind you guys waking him up.”. The officers shared a look, like they knew something I didn’t. “Sir, ‘the kid’, is dead. He committed suicide. And your name, was on the suicide note. There was nothing else, no reasoning, just your name, and the names of some people we have yet to identify. That\u0026rsquo;s why we came to you first.”\nI simply stood there, in front of these police officers, all the events of last night running through my head at 10x speed. The bleeding hands, the broken sticks. To do that much damage, you need to have been playing with anger. With rage. Bloodshot eyes, he was crying. The drums, they were his escape. Just like watching the game was my escape.\nI had just realised what I had done. I sank to my knees, as the whole story became clearer and clearer, like a foggy window being cleaned. The defeated voice, the cuts on his arms, it all made sense now. The kid had died, and it was my fault. I killed him. I felt the world slow down around me, the officer\u0026rsquo;s voices slowly being tuned out like a broken radio. My vision blurred, my skin felt cold and clammy. Then, it all went dark.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/trying_to_understand/","summary":"“It’s been a long day”, I mutter to myself as I plop myself down for the day, feeling the fatigue in my bones dissolve into the soft folds of the couch.

But in contrast, the second definition is as follows:\nA particular opinion, or attitude expressed Now, depending on who you are, you may relate to one more than the other. If you are of a more direct disposition, you may immediately associate it with the first definition; the literal meaning of voice; the produced sound. But others, on some deeper thinking, might find the second, less common meaning to make more sense to you.\nWhichever meaning of voice you relate with the most, one thing is undeniable; it is incredibly important in all aspects of life. But why is it so?\nOur voice is what we communicate with. Some of us may not realize it, but we use our voice every day, both in terms of opinions and in terms of literal sound. Any time you ask for something or talk with your friend, annoying sibling or parents, you are using your voice. See, I just did it again, and I’m not even talking, I\u0026rsquo;m writing!\nThese fervent frequencies are the one of the main things which build up the initial impression we have on people. One of the first things people use to create their mental image of us, right after appearance, is our voice. People can create a decent assumption about things such as your age and gender, and even guide their assumptions (don’t have to be accurate!) on character traits such as confidence and how trustworthy you are. In other words, our voices are what set us apart.\nBut again, as we just talked about, physical properties are not the only thing that constitute a voice. Voice also means your opinions, any attitude or ideas you have. These opinions can have a very strong effect on the world, even when you do not realize. Any time you express your opinion, someone\u0026rsquo;s brain is kicking into action, something is changing as a result; every expressed opinion makes some impact on somebody or something. For example, any time you give any presentation, or in my case as a student, whenever I work on school projects, the things you say have a huge impact on your teachers, peers, and really anyone hearing/understanding what you have to say. You might not think it is huge, but you hold the power to make them think, which is a very useful skill.\nSo what about the people who physically cannot speak? They still have a voice, but how do they express it? Well, now we might need to challenge our initial definition. If we say that someone “using their voice” means them expressing their opinion, where in that definition is it written that noise needs to be created? The actions of a person can tell us just as much about their opinions as them talking about it. In fact, most of the time it actually tells us more than we would know if they just spoke about it.\nSo maybe, the definition that we started this whole essay with, can be switched with the second definition. While scientifically and factually, the first one is still correct by a long shot, but in terms of its actual use in the world on a large scale, the second, and less popular definition seems to be the most correct one.\nThe importance of your voice is something that is being discussed much more in the modern world, but still, hundreds of people around the world do not understand just how important and powerful this one thing that all of us have, can really be. No matter if you are of the scientific stock and still think voice is nothing more than the sounds produced by your vocal tract, or believe it to be your opinions and ideas you express, our voice is one of the most important things we have, and we should cherish and utilize it to its fullest potential.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_versatile_human_voice/","summary":"If you Google the meaning of voice, it will say:\nvoice (noun) The sound produced in a person’s larynx and uttered through the mouth, such as speech or song.
